# Experiment Program of ‘Negative observational learning might play a limited role in the cultural evolution of technology’


## Computer Setting:
+ Operating Machine: Windows 10 (version 1809)
+ Monitor Size: 1920 × 1080
+ This experimental program was coded in Visual Studio 2019 (Visual Basic, Form  Application). I strongly recommend downloading Visual Studio 2019 to use in the same environment.

## How to use:
+ 1. How to execute the program: 
    + You can launch the program in two ways. 
    + (a) Open 'Projectile.sln' with Visual Studio 2019, then press the 'Start' button (with a green triangle icon). 
    + (b) Alternatively, you can launch directly without using Visual Studio 2019, by double-clicking “\Projectile_test\bin\Projectile_test.exe”. The programme is unlikely to be launched if you did not download Visual Studio 2019 (since it requires 'Microsoft .Net Framework' or maybe other applications downloaded together with Visual Studio 2019). The program is only excusable on Windows PC. I guess that this program can be executable with other versions of Windows 10 but I have not checked it.

+ 2.  How to set the condition and start trials?:
    + When you launch the program, the screen for the condition setting appears. Here, you can choose from the three options: 'Ind', 'NegSoc', 'PosSoc', each corresponding to 'asocial', 'negative' and 'positive' conditions, respectively. Tick the radio button to chose the conditioon. 
    + Also, please do not forget to put the ID in the text-entry box, where you can put numbers, alphabets, and symbols (I recommend one alphabet + numbers, e.g., C3). 
    + Once you are ready, please push 'Button1'. Then press the 'start' button on the left top of the screen. 

+ 3. How to terminate the program:
    + After participants finished all 30 trials of 3 Seasons, you can terminate by pressing 'alt'+'F4'.

+ 4. How can I use it in other languages?
    + Unfortunately, only Japanese version is available. To translate, you could only change by re-writing the source code: by replacing Japanese texts inside the source code.

+ 5. How can I get the output
    + The data is available in the “\Projectile_test\OutData” folder. The output file is created with each participant with the “ID” you input initially. 
+ 6. How can I aggregate individual data?
    + Use R code of 'data_aggregation.ipynb'
